I'm a Software Engineer at Live Building Systems. I am passionate about solving difficult technology problems, working with excellent people, and using and building awesome software.

I received my Bachelor of Science from Illinois Institute of Technology in Biomedical Engineering. My coursework included biological applications of statistics, digital signal processing, fluid dynamics, and differential equations.

In my free time, I dabble in small <a href="https://github.com/odie5533">coding projects</a>. I always enjoy exchanging ideas with others, so please don't hesitate to reach out!<br><br>
