I'm currently a Software Engineer at Live Building Systems. I am passionate about designing solutions to challenging technology problems, and deploying them in a <b>scalable</b> manner.
<!--
I am interested in data APIs, software architecture, and artificial intelligence.

I received my Bachelor of Science from Illinois Institute of Technology in Biomedical Engineering. My coursework included biological applications of statistics, digital signal processing, fluid dynamics, and differential equations.

In my free time, I dabble in small <a href="https://github.com/odie5533">coding projects</a>. I always enjoy exchanging ideas with others, so please don't hesitate to reach out!<br><br>
